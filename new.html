                    The “Panda” colorway is easily one of the Nike Dunk Low's most beloved, with its second-hand sales rivaling even the culture's finest collaborations.
                    And soon, the combination will apply its charms to the Dunk High for the second time, albeit with some very subtle adjustments.
                    Straightforward and simple, the pair features the silhouette's signature two-toned look. Black is applied to the leather overlays, taking the shape of the toe cap, eye stays, counter, and
                    Underneath, white shades the much smoother paneling underneath as well as the midsole and nylon tongue. As for what's new, only the label atop the latter has been changed noticeable, replacing its once red logo with one more neutral.

                    Over the past couple of decades, Halloween has been a keen opportunity for the Swoosh to flex its creative muscles while celebrating October 31st. 
                    Recently, the Nike Dunk Low appeared in an “Orange” and “Black” patent leather ensemble that isn't officially related to the holiday, 
                    but that's appropriate for a spooky moniker. Akin to past “Halloween” propositions, the forthcoming pair indulges in two of the colors most often associated to the scariest time of the year. 
                    Base layers deviate from the glossy overlays atop them for a white smooth leather build, allowing for some of the aforementioned tones to revel in the spotlight. 
                    Jack-o-lantern-reminiscent orange animates the majority of the low-top Nike Dunk, landing around the toe, along the tongue and across the heel in addition to the made-for-basketball traction underfoot. 
                    Black-colored contrast at the profile swooshes and “NIKE” text at the heel complete the October 31st-friendly costume, though the shoes are free of any tombstone, skull and other typical frightening graphics.

                    <hr>
                    <p class="detail">RM N/A</p>

                    Nike is constantly commemorating a number of anniversaries concurrently, with the Air Force 1's 40th taking the helm for the better part of 2022. 
                    And contrary to what its lack of notable collaborations and releases may suggest, the Air Max 97, too, is celebrating a birthday of its own — its 25th, to be exact. 
                    Thankfully, as we head into the last half of the year, the brand is finally pulling out the stops for the Christian Tresser design, as they're ushering back in the ever-iconic “Silver Bullet” colorway. 
                    Last released in 2017, the “Silver Bullet” draws inspiration from Japan's innovative bullet trains. In homage, the silhouette sports a Silver Metallic finish through much of its construction, from the mesh inserts to the leather paneling all throughout. 
                    In addition, reflective strips are tucked amidst the side's many layers, brightening up the palette in tandem with the pops of “Varsity Red” that mark every exterior Swoosh and the detailing along the outsole.
